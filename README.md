## Sänd

Sänd is a falling sand simulation made in Love2D. It's based on other falling sand games such as:
  Sandspiel by Max Bittker (his source code helped a lot)
  Orb.farm by Max Bittker 
  The Powder Toy
  wxSand
  Powder Game
  
# ToDo:
- [ ] Add multithreading (I don't really know much about multithreading in general so this may never be done)
- [ ] GPU simulation (another massive IF. I'm not good with shaders or GPU related code in general)
- [ ] UI
- [ ] Spatial hashing
